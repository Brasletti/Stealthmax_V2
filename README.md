# üå™Ô∏è StealthMax V2 ‚Äì The New Filtration Beast!

## Nevermore StealthMax was already the pinnacle of 3D printing filtration. How could we possibly improve it? Here's how:

---

## üöÄ **The Fan**

With the GPU fan from V1 becoming increasingly rare due to evolving GPU cooler designs, we searched far and wide for a powerful, reliable replacement capable of pulling substantial airflow through dense filtration media. **We found it!**

The new **StealthMax V2 fan** delivers **twice the airflow** at the **same noise level**, meaning:
- Quieter operation at equivalent airflow.
- Efficient filtration of larger chamber volumes.

Moreover, the fan is **5 mm slimmer**, making room for even more HEPA surface area. And since it's not an end-of-life (EOL) design, it should remain available for years to come! Also, contrary to any rumours, its certainly not proprietary!

## üõ°Ô∏è **The HEPA Filter**

With our upgraded fan, we can now use a vastly superior, industrial-quality HEPA filter without sacrificing airflow. Gone are the days of cheap, unspecified robovac filters!

Our new HEPA filter:
- Is **99.995% efficient** at capturing particulates (H14 standard).
- Outperforms typical cheap robovac filters by capturing up to **2000 times more particulates** per filtration pass.
- Excels specifically at capturing ultra-fine particles (UFPs: PM0.01 ‚Äì PM0.1) emitted during FDM 3D printing, which thinner, cheaper filters struggle with.

**Nevermore3D proudly offers the highest-grade FDM filtration HEPA available on the market. UFPs: YOU. SHALL. NOT. PASS!**

## ‚öôÔ∏è **The Servo-Controlled Vent**

While StealthMax V1 had an adjustable exhaust vent for controlling chamber temperatures when printing PLA, the solution wasn't optimal. Now, StealthMax V2 upgrades this feature with a **servo-controllable exhaust vent**, enabling:

- Automatic switching between exhaust and recirculation modes, tailored to your specific printing material.
- Chamber temperature management by venting air automatically whenever the chamber exceeds your specified temperature threshold.

## üí° **Intelligent Signaling**

StealthMax V2 adds smart visual signaling, making it easy to monitor your filter status at a glance:

- **Neopixel LEDs** indicating filter function status and carbon replacement intervals.
- LEDs can be installed at the Bowden caps or the main hinge.
- Optional support for a sleek **1.28" LED display** or **KNOMI 2** mounted at the main hinge for the ultimate monitoring and customization experience (currently limited software support).

---

## üîå **Expanded Accessibility**

StealthMax V2 dramatically improves user accessibility and versatility:

- **Multiple Bowden tube access points** on every side for clean and easy routing.
- **Up to 6 simultaneous Bowden tubes** supported for complex tool-changer setups.
- Integrated routing for your **PUG umbilical cable**.
- Convenient additional **CPAP intake ports** at the bottom, allowing flexible air routing throughout your machine.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Carbon Cooler (Optional Add-On)**

Let's face it‚Äîactivated carbon filtration becomes less effective as temperature rises, yet we require high chamber temperatures for optimal printing with most advanced filaments. StealthMax V2 is designed with this challenge in mind, supporting an optional **Carbon Cooler module**:

- **Peltier cooling** chills intake air, increasing carbon adsorption efficiency.
- **Waste heat is recirculated** back into the chamber, maintaining a hot environment where needed.
- Cooler carbon means more effective filtration, capturing VOCs longer, even at chamber temperatures up to 70¬∞C.

**Cooler carbon, hotter chamber? Check.**

---

## üåû **PCO (Photocatalytic Oxidation) Stage (Optional Add-On)**

StealthMax V2 comes ready for integration of an advanced **internal photocatalytic oxidation (PCO)** filtration stage:

- Utilizes **UV light-created hydroxyl radicals** to destroy volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that bypass carbon and HEPA stages.
- Mimics natural sunlight degradation of VOCs in outdoor environments.
- Degraded VOC molecules become easier to capture with subsequent carbon filtration passes, ultimately breaking down into harmless CO‚ÇÇ.

**Sunlight truly is the best disinfectant!**

---

## ‚ú® **Additional Improvements**

We've implemented numerous improvements to ensure a smoother user experience and better performance:

- Enhanced **print-in-place latch designs** for reliable, hassle-free prints.
- **Carbon container lid** now sits more securely, with additional bolts and improved geometry.
- Reduced material usage in the main chamber, optimized support structures, quicker-to-print carbon basket, better fitting lid and generally more refined.
